# Q&A

## Is Exyle.io open source?

Short answer: Technically No<br />
Long answer: Though the source code of the game (except for the client itself) is available on GitHub,
it is not licensed under a open-source-friendly license which means it can not be redistributed,
or be used in other commercial/personal projects.

## When will Exyle.io be released?

Short answer: Maybe in 2024 but there is not grantee<br />
Long answer: Though predicting the deadline of a software project is almost a taboo,
I expect to have a testable version ready by 2023, and a somewhat presentable version by the summer of 2024.
As for the full release date, don't expect it to happen until the end of 2024 but even that is not a guarantee.

Exyle.io is planned to be built using Godot 4 which is not even released yet.
Not to mention that coming up with a reliable, robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure design is difficult and time consuming.
This is also my first game (at least on this scale), so expect a bumpy ride.

Check the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) for more information about the future plans for the game.
