# Q&A

## Is Exyle.io open source?

Short answer: Technically No<br />
Long answer: Though the source code of the game is publicly available on GitHub,
it is not licensed under a open-source-friendly license which means it can not be redistributed,
or be used in commercial/personal projects.

## When will Exyle.io be released?

Short answer: Maybe in 2025 but there is no grantee<br />
Long answer: It is very difficult to predict when a project will be "finished"
since there are so many unknowns especially in the earlier stages of the development.
First, I do not know when my 18 months of mandatory military service will begin.
There could also be unexpected technical challenges, or bugs that that are particularly difficult to track down and fix.
Exyle.io is also planned to be built using the Godot 4 game engine which is not even released yet.
Not to mention that coming up with a reliable, robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure design is difficult and time consuming.
This is also my very first game dev experience (at least on this scale), so expect a bumpy ride.

Check the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) for more information about the future plans for the game.

## Will you implement X?

Check [the top list of features that won't be implemented](./fragments/wont-implement.md).

## Will you hire developers?

No.

- we are not earning enough money to hire developers
- it's much better to have a organically gathered development team
- it's difficult to find people who are passionate and can go above and beyond
- the game is open sourced anyway so anyone with development skills just come in and contribute code
- the game engine Exyle.io is using (Godot 4) is relatively unknown, it's difficult to find devs who have experience in the first place
