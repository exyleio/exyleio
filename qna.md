# Q&A

## Is Exyle.io open source?

Short answer: Technically No<br />
Long answer: Though the source code of the game (except for the client itself) is available on GitHUb, it is not licensed under a open-source-friendly license which means it can not be redistributed, or be used in other projects.

## When will Exyle.io be released?

Short answer: Not anytime soon<br />
Long answer: Exyle.io uses some technologies that are not widely adopted yet. This includes the game engine itself ([bevyengine](https://github.com/bevyengine/)), and the [WebGPU](./plans/webgpu.md) standard. Check the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) for more info.
