# Tasks

Tracking tasks with [issues](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/issues)
is good and all, but it's kinda difficult to differentiate stale ones
from the active onces. To solve this issue, we created this document to
list issues we're actively working on as well as their deadlines in
YYYY-MM-DD format (KST).
