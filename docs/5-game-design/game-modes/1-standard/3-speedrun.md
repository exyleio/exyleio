# Speedrun Game Mode

Speedrun is a game mode where players have to navigate from start to finish in the most efficient way possible.

- it is similar to [krunker.io's bhop maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z47Ssa4ZU9U)
  - but no checkpoints and falling off the map. Instead, players have to climb back up the pit.
- unlike other game modes, there is no such thing as an "end of a match" or deaths.
- option to toggle other player visibility and opacity
- option to toggle ghost player of their personal best record
- no weapons
- the timing is calculated locally, and is verified once a player reaches the end of the map,
  so this game mode only exists in one server. It will show up when players select different region,
  but the server is only located in one.
- there is an option to toggle a ghost for player's personal best and/or world best
- rating system: None. There is only a timing leaderboard
