# Will you hire developers?

## Short answer

No.

## Long answer

- I am not even close to earning minimum wage let alone enough to hire even a part-time developer
- it's much better to have a organically gathered development team
- it's difficult to find people who are passionate and can go above and beyond
- I am bad at managing people
- anyone can come in and contribute code without permission anyway
- the game engine Exyle.io is using (Godot 4) is relatively unknown, it's
  difficult to find qualified developers in the first place
