# When will Exyle.io be released?

## Short answer

Maybe in 2025 but there is no grantee

## Long answer

It is very difficult to predict when a project will be "finished" since there
are so many unknowns especially during the earlier stages of the development.
For starters, coming up with a reliable, robust, secure, and scalable
infrastructure design is difficult and time consuming. Unexpected technical
challenges are also basically guaranteed, and personal issues could also be a
factor such as the lead developer
[developomp](https://github.com/developomp)'s exam and 18 months of military
service. Plus, this is his very first game dev experience (at least on this
scale), so expect a bumpy ride.

Refer to the [roadmap](/docs/dev-status/pre-release-roadmap) for more
information about the future plans for the game.
