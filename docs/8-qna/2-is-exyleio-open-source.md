# Is Exyle.io open source?

## Short answer

Not according to my standard.

## Long answer

Although the majority of the source code of the game and its
underlying infrastructure is publicly available on GitHub, they are not
licensed under a open-source-friendly license. This means that neither the
source code nor its resulting executable binary files can be used in
commercial/personal projects or be used in such a way that can significantly
affect the game unless given explicit permission. Also, certain parts of the
client source code is intentionally left out, so it can not be edited and
recompiled for malicious purposes.
