# When will Exyle.io be released?

## Short answer

Maybe in 2025 but there is no grantee

## Long answer

It is very difficult to predict when a project will be "finished"
since there are so many unknowns especially during the earlier stages of the
development. For starters, I do not know when my 18 months mandatory military
service will begin. There could also be unexpected technical challenges and
personal issues. Not to mention that coming up with a reliable, robust, secure,
and scalable infrastructure design is difficult and time consuming. Plus, this is
my very first game dev experience (at least on this scale), so expect a bumpy ride.

plans for the game.
