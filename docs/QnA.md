# Q&A

## Is Exyle.io open source?

Short answer: Technically No<br />
Long answer: Although the majority of the source code of the game and its
underlying infrastructure is publicly available on GitHub, they are not
licensed under a open-source-friendly license. This means that neither the
source code nor its resulting executable binary files can be used in
commercial/personal projects or be used in such a way that can significantly
affect the game unless given explicit permission. Also, certain parts of the
client source code is intentionally left out, so it can not be edited and
recompiled for malicious purposes.

## When will Exyle.io be released?

Short answer: Maybe in 2025 but there is no grantee<br />
Long answer: It is very difficult to predict when a project will be "finished"
since there are so many unknowns especially during the earlier stages of the
development. For starters, I do not know when my 18 months mandatory military
service will begin. There could also be unexpected technical challenges and
personal issues. Not to mention that coming up with a reliable, robust, secure,
and scalable infrastructure design is difficult and time consuming. Plus, this is
my very first game dev experience (at least on this scale), so expect a bumpy ride.

## Will you implement X?

Read [this](./guides/community-feedback/wont-implement.md).

## Will you hire developers?

Short answer: No.<br/>
Long answer:

- I am not even close to earning minimum wage let alone enough to hire even a part-time developer
- it's much better to have a organically gathered development team
- it's difficult to find people who are passionate and can go above and beyond
- I am bad at managing people
- anyone can come in and contribute code without permission anyway
- the game engine Exyle.io is using (Godot 4) is relatively unknown, it's difficult to find qualified developers in the first place
