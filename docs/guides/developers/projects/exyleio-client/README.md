# Exyleio Client Documentation

## Introduction

This is the documentation for the
[exyleio/exyleio-client](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio-client)
repository.

## Setting up

Since the Godot 4.0 Game Engine is still in beta, it does not have a
download page in their website. To use the game engine, you could either
[compile it yourself](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling),
or [download a precompiled build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0)
that may be slightly outdated. To download the precompiled version,
open the link, select the latest beta version (`beta2` as of writing),
go to `mono`, and download the right version for your operating system.

### Compiling

- not finalized
- more info coming soon

## Learning

To contribute to this project, you will need to know college level mathematics,
college level physics, deep understanding of C#, deep understanding of networking,
and of course, the Godot 4.0 game engine itself.

## Networking

If you don't know anything about multiplayer game networking, this
[4 part blog from Godot](https://godotengine.org/article/multiplayer-changes-godot-4-0-report-1)
is a good place to start. Reading the Exyle.io infrastructure plan (WIP)
would also be helpful.
