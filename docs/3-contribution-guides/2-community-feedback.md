# Community Feedback Guide

If you are reading this, there is a high chance that you are eager to
submit a suggestion or a bug report. Well, you've come to the right place.
This document will prepare you to submit the highest quality feedback that
is not just helpful to the developers, but to the entire community.
This document is pretty short, so we advice everyone to read it in its entirety.
Feedback that do not meet our standard will be closed.

## Introduction

GitHub is a platform mainly used by developers to easily share their code,
collaborate on a project, and track suggestions/bug reports. On GitHub,
there is a page called "[issues](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/issues)".
This is where you submit suggestions and bug reports.

Issues are organized using [labels](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/labels).
Once you've opened a issue, it will only have either a `suggestion` or a `bug` label
depending on the type of issue you chose (more on this later). Once a developer have
have read your issue, they will manually assign specific labels.

## Before opening a issue

<!-- check won't implement -->

Before we learn how to open a issue, let's first make sure that we know
the basic GitHub etiquette. To prevent fragmentation of effort and information,
make sure that there are no similar or related issues created in the past.
You can check this using the search bar in the issues page.
If a duplicate/related issue does exist, you could either leave a thumbs-up (üëç) emoji,
or comment information you think it's relevant. Note here that the emoji should **NOT** be
left in the comment. You can add emojis directly to the issues. On the same note,
please refrain from sending messages like "+1", "We need this", or "I have the same problem".
They do not help anyone one bit, and it only creates clutter.
If you've accidentally created a duplicate issue, do not worry.
The developers will close your issue, tag it as duplicate, and point you to an existing one.

## How to open a issue

To open a new issue, navigate to the aforementioned
[issues page](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/issues),
click the "New issue" button, then choose the type of your issue.
You can then fill out the form, and once you think it has everything
you want to say, click the submit button. You can edit them later,
so do not be too stressed about making everything perfect. The textbox also
supports the [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet),
so it's a good idea to utilize them for maximum readability.
You can also drag and drop any file such as images, texts, and even videos.

## Discussing on discord

GitHub allows people to leave comments on issues, but not all people have
a account on GitHub, or understand how it works. And sometimes, people just
want to talk about them without any particular goal in mind. In that case,
you can join the [Exyle.io discord server](https://discord.gg/synPSeuNFK)
and do exactly that.

## Why bug reports need reproduction steps

I'd like to quote from a [reddit post from r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/qeqn3b/):

> We have all seen bug reports like: ‚Äúit crashes for me after a few hours‚Äù.
> Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best.
> You can‚Äôt really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes,
> peek inside and finally see that it‚Äôs fixed.

Even simple games like Exyle.io have so many moving parts that it is extremely difficult for us to
locate the source of a issue without a way to test them in our own computer.
That is why it is important for you to provide exact steps to replicate the bug.
