(UX), you have come to the right place.

[Flowbite](https://flowbite.com) is a UI component library used for the Exyle.io
web interface. It provides a
[design system on figma](https://figma.com/file/xOF7lECLNjnutDX31LlivW)
which you can [get a copy](https://figma.com/community/file/1179442320711977498)
of.

You can use this to test your design ideas and experiment with many different
screen sizes without touching a single line of code.
