# Financial Plan

Money is a tricky topic. While it is absolutely necessary to keep the game alive,
when dealt improperly, can takes away every charm from the game.

Exyle.io should obviously be able to pay for itself for it to be sustainable,
but since it is not my goal to make a living out of it, the amount of revenue
I'll be earning form the game will be kept at a absolute minimum.

## Supporter

The only way to financially support the game is to donate via
[patreon](https://www.patreon.com/developomp). This will unlock some supporter-exclusive
perks such as a role in the discord community server and prioritized feedback
(bug reports and suggestions). You can find more information about this in the
[Supporter Document](/docs/game-design/supporter).

## Monthly Financial Report

Since transparency is one of Exyle.io's core philosophy, all finance
related information is publicly available on GitHub (this page).

On the first day of each month (PST), a monthly financial report will be uploaded.
This contains information such as: amount earned, amount spent, amount left,
taxes, goal for next month, as well as a breakdown for each data.

## Rejected sources of revenue

### Publisher and other contracts

Let me make one thing clear: I will not take any money with strings attached.

Even if the game grows to tens of thousands of users in the future,
I will not sign any contract with any publishers or individuals.
This is to protect my complete independence and the flexibility.
Development of Exyle.io is not my main job, so I do not want it to get in the
way of my life.

### Advertisements

I have no plans to add advertisements to the game in the forseeable future.
It often contains explicit/disturbing content, makes the game look cheap,
is annoying, is a security hazard, makes the game load slower,
and can be easily be blocked with ad-blockers.

### Steam purchases

Exyle.io is a free game :D

### Micro-transactions

Micro-transactions like cosmetics and battlepass are excellent ways to earn money,
but I strongly believe these should be a reward for high level ability and dedication.
