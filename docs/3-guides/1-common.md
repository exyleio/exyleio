# Common Contribution Guide

## Introduction

There are many different ways to contribute to Exyle.io.
There is of course the obvious way of becoming a supporter at
[patreon.com/developomp](https://www.patreon.com/developomp),
but Exyle allows you to do much more than that. You could, for
instance apply for a community moderator position,
report suspicious/toxic users,
[submit suggestions/bug reports](./community-feedback),
or participate in development poll/discussion in our community
[discord server](https://discord.gg/synPSeuNFK).

However, if you would like to do even more than that, well, this
document has got you covered. Whether you're a developer, an artist,
a designer, or someone with way too much free time, this document
should get you up to speed when it comes to the contribution process
in Exyle.io.

Of course, we can't cover every area in a single document, so you will
also have to read other documents in this folder for your specific skill set.
