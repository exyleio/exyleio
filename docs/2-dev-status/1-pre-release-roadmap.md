# Exyle.io Pre-release Roadmap

## Overview

Game development is no easy task. Making a quality game takes a surprising
amount of time and effort. Which is why we have divided the development
processes into different stages. This makes it much easier for us to manage
different tasks, and prevents us from falling into the pit of unproductiveness.
You can track the progress of each stage
[here](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/milestones), and the current tasks
we're working on [here](./tasks).

Following are the four major stages of pre-release development:

1. Planning phase
2. \> (we are here) < Backbone development phase
3. Alpha development phase
4. Beta development phase
5. Release

## Planning

This is the very first stage of the development process.
No code written at this stage is expected to survive until the release.
In this stage, we explore different options and make technical decisions
that are hard to change in the future. This includes the game engine and
related libraries, online infrastructure, hosting provider, code architecture,
and other stuff of similar nature. We also prepare as much extensive documentations
and planning details as possible.

## Backbone development

If the general outline of the game is more or less complete,
it is time to build the technological foundation. This is the stage where we build
the "backbone" of the game. Basically, every code written after this point is only
an extension of the code written here. This helps us focus on adding new features
and squashing bugs instead of spending days contemplating fundamental architectural
decisions.

## Alpha development

Now that we have a solid foundation to work on, it's time to make the game feel like
an actual game. In this stage, we implement a rough prototype of the core features.
We will experiment with some wild stuff here because if it fails, we would have only
lost a small amount of time anyway.

## Beta development

Although adding shiny new features is awesome, we will have to release the game eventually.
Once we feel that the game is ready to be used by the players, we will stop adding new features
for a moment, and redirect all of our effort into squashing bugs and polishing existing features.
This includes cool graphics, nice UI, improved performance, etc. Once we've smoothed out all the
rough edges, we can finally deliver the game to the world.
