# Overview

## Introduction

This is the documentation for the
[exyleio-game](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio-game)
repository.

## Getting started

1.  Download Godot 4.

    Since the Godot 4.0 Game Engine is still in beta, it does not have a
    download section in their website. To use the game engine, you could either
    [compile it
    yourself](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling),
    or download a precompiled build from
    [downloads.tuxfamily.org](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0).
    Simply select the latest beta version (`beta5` as of writing), go to `mono`,
    and download the version corresponding to your platform.

### Compiling

- not finalized
- more info coming soon

## Learning

To contribute to this project, you will need:

- college level physics and mathematics skill
- deep understanding of the C# language and its surrounding ecosystem
- intermediate level understanding of networking
- Godot 4 game engine skills

### Learning material

- Networking

  If you don't know anything about multiplayer game networking, this
  [4 part blog from
  Godot](https://godotengine.org/article/multiplayer-changes-godot-4-0-report-1)
  is a good place to start
