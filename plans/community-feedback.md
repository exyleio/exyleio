# Community Feedback Guideline

If you are reading this, there is a high chance that you are eager to submit a suggestion or a bug report.
Well, you've come to the right place.
This document will prepare you to submit the highest quality feedback that is not just helpful to the developers,
but to the entire community. This document is pretty short, so we advice everyone to read it in its entirety.
Feedback that do not meet our standard will be closed.

## Introduction

Exyle uses GitHub to manage everything.
That includes: code hosting, developer collaboration, testing, deployment, and of course, community feedbacks.
On GitHub, there is a page called "issues".
This is where people go to submit suggestions and bug reports.
Unless you are familiar with programming and GitHub collaboration,
all you need to care about is the [exyleio issues page](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/issues).

## GitHub etiquette

Before we teach you how to submit a issue, we first want to make sure that you know the basic GitHub etiquette.
To prevent fragmentation of effort and information, make sure that there are no similar issues created in the past.
You can check this using the search bar in the issues page.
If they exist, you could either leave a thumbs-up (üëç) emoji, or comment information you think it's relevant.
Please do not comment with a emoji. You can add emojis directly to the issue.
On the same note, please refrain from sending messages like "+1", "We need this", or "I have the same problem".
They do not help anyone one bit, and it only creates clutter.
If you've accidentally created a duplicate issue, do not worry.
The developers will close your issue, tag it as duplicate, and point you to an existing one.

## How to open a issue

To create a new issue, navigate to the aforementioned issues page,
click the "New issue" button, then choose the type of your issue.
Fill out the form (some parts are required while others are not),
and once you think it has everything you want to say, click the submit button.
You can edit them later, so do not be too stressed about making everything perfect.
The textbox also supports the [GitHub markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax),
so it's a good idea to learn those to make the issue more readable.
You can also drag and drop any file such as images, texts, and even videos.

Issues are organized using [labels](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/labels).
Once you've submitted an issue, it will only have either a `suggestion` or a `bug` label.
The developers will manually assign labels after reading your issue.

## Discussing on discord

GitHub allows people to leave comments on issues, but not all people have a GitHub account, or understand how to use it.
And sometimes, people just want to talk about them without any particular goal in mind.
In that case, you can join the [Exyle.io discord server](https://discord.gg/synPSeuNFK) and do exactly that on the `#dev-discussion` channel.

## Why bug reports need reproduction steps

I'd like to quote from a [reddit post from r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/qeqn3b/):

> We have all seen bug reports like: ‚Äúit crashes for me after a few hours‚Äù.
> Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best.
> You can‚Äôt really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes,
> peek inside and finally see that it‚Äôs fixed.

Even simple games like Exyle.io have so many moving parts that it is extremely difficult for us to
locate the source of a issue without a way to test them in our own computer.
That is why it is important for you to provide exact steps to replicate the bug.
