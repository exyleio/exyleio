# Exyle.io Roadmap

Game development is no easy task.
Making a quality game takes a surprising amount of time and effort.
That's why I have divided the development processes into different stages so it is much easier for me to manage different tasks,
and to prevent myself from falling into the pit of unproductiveness.
You can track the progress of each stage [here](https://github.com/exyleio/exyleio/milestones).

Following are the five major stages of development:

## Planning

**(we are here)**

This is the very first stage of the development process.
No code written at this stage is expected to survive until the release.
In this stage, we explore different options and make technical decisions that are hard to change in the future.
This includes the game engine and related libraries, online infrastructure, hosting provider, code architecture, and many many more.
We also prepare as much extensive documentations and planning details as possible.

## Proof of concept

If the general outline of the game is more or less complete,
it is time to build the technical foundation.
This is the stage where we build the backbone of the game.
Basically every code written after this point is only an addition to the code written at this stage of the development.
This helps us focus on adding new features and squashing bugs instead of spending days contemplating fundamental architectural decisions for days.

## Alpha dev

Now that we have a solid foundation to work on, it's time to make the game feel like an actual game.
In this stage, we fine tune the "game feel" until it's just right.
This includes the control, weapon balance, map design, UI structure, etc.

## Beta dev

Now that the core of the game is complete,
it's time to work on non-critical and/or nice-to-have features such as clans, friends, skins (custom UI, audio, texture, etc.), pretty 3D assets, etc.
This is the most repetitive, boring, and time-consuming part of the development, so expect us to stay in this stage for a very long time.

## Release

Although adding shiny new features is awesome, we will have to release the game eventually.
Once the game has enough feature to not feel incomplete,
we will stop adding new features for a moment and redirect all of our effort into squashing bugs and polishing existing features.
Once we've smooth out all the rough edges, we can finally deliver the game to the public.
Once we make sure that everything is working smoothly, we can start adding new features again.
