## WebGPU

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU):

> WebGPU is the working name for a future web standard and JavaScript API for accelerated graphics and compute, aiming to provide "modern 3D graphics and computation capabilities".

Basically, [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu) is a successor to WebGL which allows up to [quadruple performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20p7GR-nTeM) in terms of fps in some test cases.
Currently, it is only available as an experimental feature in some browsers, however, it is planned to become a web standard in the following years.
